# CHESS
Hey this i Roshan Sirohi with the chess project it is a small chess game with command line inputs The chess is left to right instead of top to bottom as i found it easier to code left is whites and right is blacks and as always whites move first no AI if you have a friend play with him or you can play by yourself how to input moves will be shown when program is run "PLEASE REPL TO RUN IT" as i used it most of the time for this project and in VScode it was giving an error there is a small error at check mate and the starting move of pawn is not two spaces (when tried to code the two spaces the whole code was falling apart and i couldn't figure it out so the starting move that pawn can move is only one) there are no errors otherwise
